// Rewrite the above program to print the greatest factor of a number beside itself using a while loop.
//Hint =>
//Get an integer input and assign it to the number variable. As well as define a greatestFactor variable and assign it to 1
//Create a variable counter and assign counter = number - 1; Use the while loop till the counter is equal to 1.
//Inside the loop, check if the number is perfectly divisible by the counter then assign the counter to greatestFactor variable and break the loop.
//Display the greatestFactor variable outside the loop
